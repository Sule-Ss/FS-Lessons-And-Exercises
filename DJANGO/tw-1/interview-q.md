#### PEP 8 nedir python için neden önemlidir?

- PEP 8 is a document that provides various guidelines to write the readable in Python. PEP 8 describes how the developer can write beautiful code. It was officially written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. The main aim of PEP is to enhance the readability and consistency of code.
> Kodun okunabilirliğini artırmak için 2001 yılında Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw ve Nick Coghlan tarafından yazılan yönergedir.

- PreClass : PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. PEP 8 is a coding convention, a set of recommendation, about how to write your Python code more readable. In other words, PEP 8 is a document that gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.

- Some Important PEP 8 Rules :

> - Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
> - Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
> - Avoid trailing whitespace anywhere. Because it's usually invisible, it can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a newline does not count as a line continuation marker.
>- Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -=, etc.), comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <>, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not).

### Soru 2:
#### What are decorators in Python?

- Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

### Soru 3:
#### What is 'pass' statement in Python?

- The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.

### Soru 4:
#### What is a Foreign Key in SQL?

- A Foreign Key is a database key that is used to link two tables together. The FOREIGN KEY constraint identifies the relationships between the database tables by referencing a column, or set of columns, in the Child table that contains the foreign key, to the PRIMARY KEY column or set of columns, in the Parent table.
